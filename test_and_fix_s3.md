# S3 Configuration Test and Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ S3 Configuration Issues
- Fixed AWS S3 settings in both development and production
- Added proper fallback to local storage when AWS credentials are missing
- Added debug logging to track S3 configuration status

### 2. ✅ Device Compatibility Issues
- Updated CORS settings to allow cross-device access
- Added production URL to allowed origins
- Created environment-based configuration for Flutter app

### 3. ✅ Flutter App Configuration
- Created `AppConfig` class for environment management
- Updated API client to use production URL when needed
- Added support for switching between development and production

## How to Test the Fixes:

### Step 1: Test S3 Configuration
Run the test script to verify S3 setup:

```bash
cd backend
python test_s3_config.py
```

This will show:
- ✅ If AWS credentials are set
- ✅ If S3 bucket is accessible
- ✅ If Django is configured correctly

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Railway
Add these variables to your Railway project:

1. **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** - Your AWS Access Key
2. **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** - Your AWS Secret Key
3. **AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME** - Your S3 bucket name
4. **AWS_S3_REGION_NAME** - Your S3 region (e.g., ap-south-1)

### Step 3: Test Photo Upload
1. Deploy the updated backend to Railway
2. Try uploading a photo through your Flutter app
3. Check if the photo appears in your S3 bucket

### Step 4: Test Cross-Device Access
1. Build Flutter app for production:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true
   ```
2. Install on different devices
3. Test if photos load correctly

## Expected Results:

### If S3 is working correctly:
- ✅ Photos upload to S3 bucket
- ✅ Photo URLs are accessible from any device
- ✅ No more "working on my device but not others" issues

### If S3 is not configured:
- ⚠️ Photos will be stored locally (fallback)
- ⚠️ Photos will only work on the server device
- ⚠️ You'll see "AWS credentials not found" in logs

## Troubleshooting:

### If photos still don't upload to S3:
1. Check Railway environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify S3 bucket exists and is accessible
3. Check IAM permissions for the AWS user
4. Look at Railway logs for error messages

### If app still doesn't work on other devices:
1. Make sure you're using the production build
2. Check if the production URL is accessible
3. Verify CORS settings in Django

## Quick Commands:

```bash
# Test S3 configuration
cd backend && python test_s3_config.py

# Build Flutter app for production
flutter build apk --dart-define=PRODUCTION=true

# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Deploy to Railway
railway up
```

## Next Steps:
1. Set up AWS S3 bucket and credentials
2. Add environment variables to Railway
3. Deploy updated backend
4. Test photo uploads
5. Build and test Flutter app on different devices
